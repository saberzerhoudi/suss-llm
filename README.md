# SussLLM: Simulated User Search Sessions with Large Language Models

Source code for our paper :  
***SussLLM: Simulated User Search Sessions with Large Language Models***


## Overview

SussLLM is a Python-based simulation framework designed to model user search behavior using advanced large language models (LLMs). It generates realistic user profiles and search sessions to better understand and analyze how users interact with search engines.



### ðŸš¨ Upcoming Release Alert ðŸš¨
**SussData**, the comprehensive dataset generated by SussLLM, will be **soon published on Zenodo** for public access and research use. Stay tuned!

## Features

- **User Profile Simulation**: Generate detailed user profiles based on behavioral and component-oriented attributes.
- **Search Session Simulation**: Simulate dynamic search sessions including queries, clicks, and decisions.
- **Reasoning with LLMs**: Integrate large language models to enhance simulation realism by generating user reasoning and decision-making processes.
- **Dataset Management**: Handle and manipulate datasets of simulated search sessions and real-world data.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable for various simulation scenarios and different LLMs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management

## Configuration

Set your own API keys in the environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
export BING_API_KEY='your-bing-api-key' 
```

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sussllm.git
cd sussllm
```

Install the project dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

### Running Simulations

To run simulations, use the `run_simulation.py` script:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/run_simulation.py
```

This script generates user profiles, simulates their search sessions, and logs the output.

### Evaluating Models

To evaluate your IR models with the simulated data, use the `evaluate_model.py` script:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/evaluate_model.py
```

Ensure you have a trained model and a dataset path set correctly in the script.
